# A short description of the log

Actually, i may have forgotten some things to add in the log. As i think that english is a useful language to master, i tend to do things in english or in french like they were equal to me. For exemple, when i watch youtube videos, sometimes i can't remember if the video was in french or in english. That is due to the habbits i am willing to developp.
