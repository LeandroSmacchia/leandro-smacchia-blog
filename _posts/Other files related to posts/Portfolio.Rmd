# Introduction

How about we take a look at A.I.D.S.

![The red ribbon (the universal symbol of awareness and support for people living with HIV)](../2019-10-13-introduction/Image/ruban.png)


## HIV / A.I.D.S.

The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or **A.I.D.S.** is the associated disease of the Human Immunodefciency Virus commonly known as **HIV**.
The HIV is part of the virus family called **retroviruses** which means it is an RNA virus that transcript his genes backwards to insert them in the host cell's DNA. This has as a consequence that the host cell expresses viral genes like they were part of its initial genome. The HIV is spread by unprotected sex, blood transfusions, etc.

Infection by the HIV initiates with, after two to four weeks a stage of few or no symptoms which include fever, a flu-like illness, etc. It then develops and goes though another stage before reaching the final state of the infection : **A.I.D.S.**. People affected by A.I.D.S have low immunity and are thus subjects to various infections and tumors.


## My portfolio

Here, we are taking a look at this widespread disease for which we don't have a cure yet. Indeed most person infected by the virus are treated with **antiretroviral therapy**. What i am trying to do and to share is **understanding the disease** with the newest informations about the virus and the last discoveries/studies. I also have a particular interest in new approaches to treatments like **gene therapy and other new treatments**.

The articles of this portfolio will be sorted in three categories :

* Understanding the disease
* Antiretroviral therapy
* Gene therapy and other new treatments

I hope this portfolio will entertain your interest and, i am sure, make you learn some things.

| **General topic** | Discovery of a gene that regulates HIV replication in immune cells |
| **Procedure / what was examined** | Antiretroviral therapy prevents HIV to infect the whole body and cause AIDS. It does not cure patients. When untreated, HIV spreads thgough the organism.

| **General topic** | Treatment of the HIV and the sickle cell disease with gene therapies |
| **Procedure / what was examined** | Antiretroviral does not cure HIV. Moreover, it is often times not affordable in some countries. Previous tries in gene therapies weren't more affordable either. They try here to develop gene therapies to cure those diseases and to dispense it at a reasonable price. They will focus on "In vivo" gates. |
| **Conclusion / discovery** | It will be a long-term investment for this alliance. |
| **Remaining questions** | One way to do this could be taking off the gene for the CCR5 receptor (useful to make the HIV enter the cells). A second way could be removing the proviral DNA that the retroviral virus printed into the genome (it still is present throughout the body after years of medication). |

| **Conclusion / discovery** | The two patients undergoing the stem cells transplant are now considered cured of HIV |
| **Remaining questions** | Although it won't be a treatment for all people infected by the virus, it installs a new path to a cure. |




# Conclusion

One day the A.I.D.S. symbol will be flipped into a 'V' for victory.

![The red ribbon with hope](../2020-04-25-conclusion/Image/Hope.jpg)


# My blog in a nutshell

The HIV is a virus still full of mysteries. Numerous scientists are trying to see through its secrets and yet, we haven't developed any cure. Indeed, most HIV positive people are on antiretroviral therapy which helps them to live a normal life, but without being cured. 

However, the future is promising. We go through more and more discoveries and some of them are breakthough like the place where the virus hide in our body.
Two people have even been cured of HIV ! How extraordinary this is ? We know that with a certain mutation of a certain gene, we can be immune to HIV.

So, there is hope. Hope of finding a cure one day and eradicate this scary virus.


# My thoughts

It was very interesting reading about new major discoveries and new paths to finding a cure. I am not disapointed of the things that i've learned. It was also very interesting and kind of fun to see that antiretroviral therapy could improve conditions for people with liver fibrosis. It shows us that we are not safe from surprises, and that good news can come from a bad situation.

I hope reading this portfolio was pleasant to you and that it caught your interest.
