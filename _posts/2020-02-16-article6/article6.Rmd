## Analysis table 

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| **Researchers** | Sean Graves, Marcelo Marcet-Palacios and namely Weijie Sun from the university of Alberta |
| **Date of publication and newspaper** | 12-13-2019 / *ScienceDaily* |
| **General topic** | The shape of the HIV virus and its implications. |
| **Procedure / what was examined** | The shape previously used to visualise the HIV-1 virus shell was mathematically examined and proven to be impossible. Still with a mathematical approach, they tried to create a new model. |
| **Conclusion / discovery** | A new "flower-like" model with "petals" opening to inject the virus into the target cell is proposed. |
| **Remaining questions** | If it is correct, this new shape could lead to finding a way of blocking its mechanisms, namely those of viral entry. |
