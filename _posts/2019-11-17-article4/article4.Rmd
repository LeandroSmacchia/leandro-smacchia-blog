## Analysis table 

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
| **Researchers** | Andrew Harman and Tony Cunningham from The Westmead Institute for Medical Research |
| **Date of publication and newspaper** | 21-06-2019 / *Medical Xpress* |
| **General topic** | Discovery of the first immune cells that are on contact with HIV. |
| **Procedure / what was examined** | They look at genital tissues and used a new RNAscope technology which allowed them to one of these cells to take and transfer the virus.|
| **Conclusion / discovery** | These cells that are called CD11c+ dendritic cells capture a pathogen (in this case HIV virus) and communicate it to the CD4 T cells in the lymph nodes to help the immune system preparing. By doing so, they lead the HIV to their main targets, the CD4 T cells. |
| **Remaining questions** | Prevent HIV from binding to the CD11c+ dendritic cells ? Develop a vaccine ? |
